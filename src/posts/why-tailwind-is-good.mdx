I don't expect everyone to agree with the opinions in this post, but I had to write it anyway.

I've seen a lot of CSS frameworks go by over the years, and until about six months ago I thought Tailwind was just another passing CSS framework having its moment in the spotlight.

But then I tried it. Something felt strange. I was still thinking in CSS, but I was moving faster. I felt like I was writing CSS, but I was taking shortcuts.
