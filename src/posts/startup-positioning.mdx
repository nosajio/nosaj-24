};

Positioning is the foundation of sales, marketing, product. It's a point of view on the market.

Positioning defines how your product is the best at the world at delivering something. Something that a defined set of customers cares a lot about.

It’s the context you frame your product in. A conversation starter.

Chocolate cake at breakfast example:
Tim Hortons sells a “double chocolate salted caramel muffin”. It’s a chocolate cake. But by making it the shape of a muffin and selling it at breakfast time, it’s acceptable to customers to buy at 8am with their morning coffee.

Emotion drives sales. When selling to business, the emotion to solve for is fear. Not buying the features, buying the benefit. Or buying the **prevention of something negative from happening**.

Think in categories. Emerging categories (like LLMs in 2023) are hard because we don't yet know how to talk about them. The goal is to attempt to define what is and isn’t important about the market category.

Name key concepts inside of the new market category to your advantage and to help customers understand the concept / problem / technology.

There's two tried and tested get to market strategies:

1. Find an underserved corner of the market. Serve it well, and expand from there. (90%)
2. Find an emerging category and define that part of the market with positioning and marketing (10%)
