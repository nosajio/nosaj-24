At the start of 2020 I was contacted by a SF founder called Matt. He sent me a demo he built on Firebase for a compensation platform that I didn't understand all that well. I thought the demo was fun though, so I agreed to help him build his product.

A few days into working with Matt I remember thinking "this is going somewhere". I still didn't get the product or why Matt was so excited about it, but I didn't need to get it. I knew Matt would make it because every day I worked with him it felt meaningful. It felt like we were moving and it was intoxicating. 

Today Matt's company, Pave, is valued at over $1bn. And this is not at all surprising to me. Actually I'd be more surprised if Matt didn't build Pave into a unicorn.

Since I worked with Matt I've been lucky to feel the same feeling a few more times. 

When the startup exists more in the realm of ideas than reality, the only way to change that is with energy. Energy isn't free. People can't just force it. It must be cultivated.
